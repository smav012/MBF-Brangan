  <h3>Anecdotal Interviews</h3>
  <p>"So I have multiple jobs working and I was surviving. All I was waiting for was the city to have professional people actually do the work that they're supposed to do with the vouchers and emergency housing and emergency social assistance. We don't have enough group homes. We don't have enough emergency shelters. We don't have enough professional people in those areas." - Ariana Rankin at 08:41</p>
  <p>"The way the police officers handle the younger... the young ones, like maybe try to lead them in a better way and instead of chasing them every time they see them and hopping down on them and falsely accusing them of taking them to jail, even though sometimes they didn't do nothing, [and] sometimes they deserved it." - Mya Rodrique at 37:05</p>
