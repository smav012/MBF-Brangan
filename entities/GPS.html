  <h3>Funding</h3>
  <p>$350,000 allocated towards “increased electronic monitoring capacity” in FY2024; unclear if for all probation or pre-trial services.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Current Legislative Initiatives</h3>
  <p>HD.1670 / SD.1033 (2023-2024): penalties for tampering with GPS devices; paired with SD.1032 / S.1098 (felony, minimum 2 years imprisonment). Last actions: 8/8/24 & H.4989/HD.2482 comprehensive bill draft.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
  <p>Illinois pre-trial GPS law (720 ILCS 5/110-5 & 730 ILCS 5/5-8A-4): prosecutors prove need, judges reconsider every 60 days, limited freedom restrictions, credit for time served while monitored.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Anecdotal Interviews</h3>
  <p>"In the beginning, when you have it, it feels like the lesser of two evils... The ankle monitor doesn't do anything, it just is the mechanism used to know where the person is. If they do decide to do the crime, it just keeps them locally, it just keeps them controled in their element." - Charlese Jackson at 11:45 to 12:20</p>
  <p>"And I think the person should be interviewed before they get the equipment. I think that, that's what they don't do. They don't look at your circumstance or your situation. They just throw you on an ankle monitor. They don't know if you've lived 20 miles from the grocery store. They don't know if you have children at home like dogs at home, animals at home. They don't know if your pharmacy is 2 miles away."  - Charlese Jackson at 13:52 to 14:23 </p>
  <p>"...Gave it to him from 8:00 to 6:00, which still probably wasn't really enough time, because now he was trying to work his stuff. But the doctor told him he was on GPS, so you can't work. It was really hard for him to just be, you know, a regular person like from for try to provide for big kids and stuff because he couldn't go outside because of something that the police wrongfully accused him of." - Mya Rodrique at 06:47</p>
  <p>"So I had a 9:00 curfew. I had a 7:00 and 9:00. So 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM...So everything like I had an overnight job that I ended up losing because I couldn't go to it no more because I was... I had the bracelet." - Kaaron Brown at 17:23</p>
