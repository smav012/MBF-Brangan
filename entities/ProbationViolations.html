  <p>California (AB1950-2020), Louisiana (SB139-2017), New York (S4664A-2014), Virginia (HB5148-2020) - eliminated minimum sentences, set caps on probation sentences, awarded “compliance credits” REFORM.</p>
  <p>New York (S1144A-2021) - “Less is More” Act that restricts incarceration from some technical violations.</p>
  <p>Michigan (S1050-2020) - restricts the amount of time a person can be incarcerated for technical violations of probation</p>

  <h3>Anecdotal Interviews</h3>
  <p>"I have one only when I was like in juvenile, I was like 14. I violated it. I was only out for like a month or something... Just, I mean, when I was like 14, I was a kid. I was misguided and I didn't... And I thought life was different. And then definitely it took me a long time." - John Quinn at 19:04 to 21:23 (part 1).</p>
  <p>"He did the time because I think it was probably a violation, why they held him for so long to like 7-8 months, and then they released him on bail. And then yeah, soon when his trial is over in a few days and he believed to win his case, hopefully he will get money back. We'll get our money." - Mya Rodrique at 05:23.</p>
  <p>"They was judging me for, they made a mistake one time where I was being held in two places... I was on probation and I said on Superior. But I had a district case, so I beat the district case, so the stupid *** correctional officer comes up. They all corrupt anyway. Even my lawyer was corrupt. So stupid." - Alex Graham at 52:21.</p>
  <p>"[So it's sort of like they stop people randomly, but by association, like, oh, they stopped them once before or they kind of know... and then they happen to get lucky that somebody actually does have something going on that they can get them for.] Yeah, 9 times out of 10 someone is always on probation... or parole. That's the reason and that and that was always my thing too. I was always on probation...That's the reason for them to hold you." - Tahkeese Brown at 22:14.</p>
