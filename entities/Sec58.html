  <h3>Current Legislative Initiatives</h3>
  <p>Bill S.1153 (back in 2022, nothing that says “cash bail” since then). Details how cash bail is gonna work, as well as Section 58 (dangerousness). Titled “An Act to safely reduce the use of cash bail” but that’s because they are “improv[ing] the effectiveness of the pretrial release system in order to protect the public and reduce the reliance on cash bail”. Also, “it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public safety and convenience.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
  <p>July 2022 - ~$30million for OCC and operation of community corrections centers, including $2m for Ralph Gants reentry services program • $30,789,862 for OCC in FY2024.</p>
  <p>New Jersey Criminal Justice Reform Act (RTF pg 15): codified that everyone (except those facing life imprisonment) had right to pre-trial release. Tried to fix problems with unaffordable bails, but caved and set up a commission for RATs for those cases. While it took some unilateral power away from judges (pretrial detention had to be motioned by prosecutor) it overall increased the power of the court system to detain people pretrial. New Jersey has right to cash bail in their constitution. Normalized RATs (which used racist algorith) in court, increased citation and booking process, overall boosting surveillance powers while lessening some detention powers. Also increased funding for pretrial system.</p>
  <p>Atlanta 2018 Municipal Ordinance (RTF pg 21): got rid of cash bail for city ordinance violations and very low level charges (which had been used to disproportionately target marginalized communities. Was very effective in reducing pretrial populations as it was a blanket coverage for "'less serious' charges". Has been fought against since its implementation and has limited coverage but covers what it does well. May still feed into a "deserving" narrative for higher offenses and still has some exceptions within it's own scope.</p>
  <p>Colorado - 2019 State Legislative Reform (RTF 31): Did the same as Atlanta but made sure to emphasize that this was only the first step and are still pushing for more expansive measures. Toolkit calls for being critical of "first steps" since that narrative may be used to silence abolitionist criticism.</p>
  <p>Texas - 2019 Federal Lawsuit Settlement (RTF 36): Removes secured money bond and instead uses unsecured/no cash bond for misdemeanor charges. Runs into the same problems as above except it also increases PIC funding to set up the new system of bonds.</p>
  <p>Illinois Pretrial Fairness Act (PFA) 2023: abolished cash bail and created a statutory presumption that individuals be released pretrial.</p>
  <p>Toward Safety, Liberty, and Equity: A Community-Centered Framework for Redesigning Minnesota's Pretrial System  Minnesota Justice Research Center, February, 2025 (REFORMIST).</p>

  <h3>Anecdotal Interviews</h3>
  <p>"If you're poor, if you're poor and you're going through the system, then they can get you. They can get you looped in, like if you get a bail that's too high for you because you're low income and you're actually not even an addict." - John Quinn at 09:47 (part 2).</p>
  <p>"Oh yeah, well, most of the bails that are set in the urban community... are higher than what their, you know, socioeconomic statuses, so if you notice that when they set the bails, most of these families can't afford it because they're from a like a lower economic status and not a higher economic status, like in the suburbs. You don't ever see the bails being set at numbers that they can’t, you know, attain. So when the judges in the urban community and in the city are setting bails, they don't ever look at if you can afford it, they actually look at if you can't afford it, because if they know you can't, then that will keep you there longer." -Charlese Jackson at 2:09 to 2:47.</p>
  <p>[I said and to confirm you yourself have never experienced a judge considering your circumstances and lowering your bail...] "No, I, I have had judges give you a personal recognizance. So I mean, it all depends. Some judges have been OK, have empathy, so I can't say all of them. You know. You know, some have... Depends on the person... Depends on the morning. Remember there's the charge, so it depends on how you catch them. It really does... And that's, that's how it is like, you know, they're tired. It's the end of the day. It's early in the morning. Did they get enough sleep last night, what mood they’re in, their relationship with the lawyer. You know, it's a lot of things sometimes, whether they were a former prosecutor, or whether they were a former defense attorney, all those things come into play." -Charlese Jackson at 3:58 to 5:06.</p>
  <p>"But in our neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, our friends' neighborhoods, we don't get personals. We get like $1000 bail." - Robert Hall at 6:11.</p>
